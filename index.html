                    <h2>What is Fitbit Charge 2?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The FitBit Charge 2 is amongst the latest products released from FitBit. The sleek wrist-wearable tracks your heart rate 24/7, calculates calories burned, automatically detects exercises, tracks and evaluates your sleep, notifies you for calls, texts and alerts, and offers guided breathing sessions.<br><br>
                        The accompanying FitBit App helps you set your goals and track your nutrition, hydration and fitness levels.<br> <br>
                        No doubt I am one of the New Year’s resolution-ers who flocked to buy a FitBit and commit to a healthier 2017; but because of product integrity and sleekness, the FitBit Charge 2 is a keeper.<br>

                    <h2>Why it Works</h2>
                    <p>
                        Being fit, or at least the idea of being fit, is in. Yet, even as the diet and fitness industry flourishes, rates of physical activity remain low, and we continue to eat far too much processed, nutritionally devoid foods.<br><br>
                        So, how will this fitness product <span style="font-style:italic;">actually</span> better one's health? When it comes to fitness, personal makes all the difference. For wearables, the body becomes a part of the hardware, making the device truly personal. FitBit Charge 2 is a product with integrity because of its <span style="font-weight: 900; color:#663492">honest</span> and <span style="font-weight: 900; color:#663492"> holistic </span> approach to your health.

                    <h2>Honest</h2>
                    <p>
                    FitBit’s honest approach to fitness is a refreshing break from what we <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/weight-loss-fitness">normally see</a> in the Health and Fitness Industry. Many fitness products take the standpoint that you either are or are not fit. The products communicate that being out of shape is bad. You should look a certain way. You should weigh this amount. Use this miracle pill or diet plan or fitness video or treadmill and you will FINALLY look good!!<br><br>

                    FitBit is different. The Charge 2 app focuses on where you stand against your own goals. The device is personal and keeps you accountable with an organized and discrete display of where you have been successful and where you have been off track. FitBit doesn’t make bold, inauthentic claims about changing your life. It uses real data –– calories burned, steps walked, resting heart rate –– and while the device offers reminders to get up and move and clear communication about over/under eating, you are ultimately  given free reign to find the balance that motivates you to achieve your fitness goals. <br><br>

                    FitBit is successful because users feel like they’ve made their own decisions about their fitness, leaving them powerful and already successful.
