                    <p>
                        While I admit that am that I am one of the many New Year’s resolution-ers who flocked to buy a Fitbit and commit to a healthier 2017, I am confident that I'll be wearing the device throughout the new years to come.

                    <h2>HONEST</h2><br>
                    <p>
                        Fitbit’s honest approach is a refreshing break from what we <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/weight-loss-fitness">normally see</a> in the Health and Fitness Industry. Many fitness products take the standpoint that you either are or are not fit. The products communicate that you don’t look good yet. These products are a nagging reminder of imperfections and the user becomes focused on proving the product wrong. This kind of "guilt driven" business model creates a dishonest product.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>

                        <span class="highlight">Fitbit is honest. The Charge 2 app focuses on where you stand against your own goals.</span> The device is personal and keeps you accountable with an organized and discrete display of where you have been successful and where you have been off track. Fitbit doesn’t make bold, inauthentic claims about looking better. It uses real data &#8212; calories burned, steps walked, resting heart rate &#8212; and friendly reminders to empower you with the tools to achieve your fitness goals.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                        <span class="highlight">The Fitbit Charge 2 is honest because users make their own decisions about their fitness, leaving them powerful and already successful.</span>

                    <h2>HOLISTIC</h2><br>
                    <p>
                    The mind and spirit are as important as the body in the journey towards sustainable health. The Charge 2 takes a holistic approach to fitness because it includes sleep tracking for a sharper mind and guided deep breathing sessions for a happier spirit.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                    Fitbit’s attention to the user is vital to the success of Charge 2 as a health and fitness product. The sleeping and breathing features remind users that balance is key. <span class="highlight">Fitbit’s holistic approach stands out amongst its competitors, who often focus on activity and nutrition only, failing to keep the user’s most desired outcome in mind: fulfillment.</span>
                    </p><br>
                    <p>

                    Additionally, Fitbit Charge 2 recognizes that its users have vibrant lives that aren’t defined by their fitness goals. For this reason, the Fitbit Charge 2 wearable is fun and sleek. It has interchangeable bands so users can sport different colors and styles and bring self expression to their health.</p><br>
                    <p>
                    <span class="highlight">The Fitbit Charge 2 is holistic in its approach, empowering users to stay focused on the mind, body and spirit.</span>

                    <p>
                    Fitbit constantly collects data about sleep, nutrition, hydration, relaxation, and exercise. There are insights to gather about why an individual achieves her goals. It’s very possible, for example, that a good night's sleep is one's highest indicator of exercising. For others, drinking plenty of water is the highest indicator. Everyone has different patterns.</p><br>
                    <p>
                    If an individual knew <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> she achieved her goals, she would better accomplish them. <span class="highlight">I conducted a survey to test my hypothesis.</span> I asked USC students if they were interested in learning what contributes to a good night’s sleep, motivation to exercise, better eating, and an overall better mood.
